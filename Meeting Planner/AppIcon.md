## Implementation Notes

### Vector Format
Create in vector format (SVG/PDF) for scalability across all sizes.

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Visible at 16x16px (Spotlight search)
- [ ] Clear at all required sizes

- [ ] Distinct from similar apps in App Store
- [ ] Represents app functionality clearly

### App Store Optimization

- Avoid common travel/meeting app clichés
- Test visibility in App Store search results
- Consider A/B testing different variations

## Alternative Concepts

### Concept 2: Meeting Table with Routes
- Round meeting table with flight paths converging
- Represents bringing people together from different locations

### Concept 3: Calendar with Airplane
- Calendar grid with airplane crossing dates
- Emphasizes scheduling and travel coordination

### Concept 4: Cost Chart with Location
